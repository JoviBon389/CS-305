1.) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They wanted us to address  Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their current software.

2.) What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think that I was able to make run the vulnerability check on their software particularly well, and with the check I was ablke to identify the security flaws in their work. It's important to code securely so that any security breaches are minimized. Software security brings a lot to the table by making sure sensitive documentation is secured behind well executed code that won't be broken into.

3.) What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I think the only issue I had with the vulnerability assessment was making sure what description of the vulnerabilities best described the vulnerability, as the vulnerability report brought back a lot of links for each vulnerability.

4.) How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

By adding a cipher, more notably AES to increase layers of security. I think on top of vulnerability assessments, I would also run layers of ciphers for extra security.

5.) How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Honestly, I believe i knew how the refactored code should operate in theory, and I think it was easyto follow in concept, but I could not verify the functionality because my code would not compile.

6.) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used mostly answered questions on Stack Overflow and some of Java's open libraries for ideas.

7.) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I think that my Project 1 would be something to show employers
